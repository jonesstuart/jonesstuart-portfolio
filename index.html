						The problem and the scope
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Every successful project begins with a clear understanding of the problem at hand and
								the scope within which it must be solved.
								This first step is all about framing the project correctly, ensuring that all
								stakeholders are aligned, and establishing a foundation that will guide the rest of the
								design process.
								At this stage, I collaborate closely with clients, stakeholders, and internal teams to
								gather as much context and information as possible.
								Through in-depth discussions, surveys, and review of any existing documentation, I
								identify the core objectives, constraints, and pain points that the project aims to
								address.
								<br><br>
								Defining the scope is crucial because it outlines the parameters of the project—what is
								within scope and what is not—ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.
								This clarity minimises scope creep and helps manage expectations throughout the
								project's lifecycle.
								A well-delineated scope will also inform decisions on functionality, user flows, and
								technical requirements.
								By diving deep into the business goals and the context surrounding the project, I
								establish a clear roadmap for the next phases.
								This understanding also allows me to highlight any potential risks early on, from
								technical challenges to user adoption hurdles, so we can address them proactively.
								<br><br>
								Additionally, setting out clear success metrics early on helps everyone involved measure
								progress and know when the project is truly complete.
								Whether it’s a target conversion rate, user retention goal, or market share increase,
								these key performance indicators (KPIs) give us a solid foundation for decision-making
								throughout the design and development process.
								In sum, a well-defined problem and scope ensure that all subsequent efforts stay
								focused, purposeful, and aligned with business goals, creating a strong foundation for
								the work to come.

						Empathise, research and explore
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								With a clear understanding of the problem and scope in place, the next step in the
								process is to build empathy for the end users.
								The goal here is to dive deep into understanding who the users are, what they need, what
								their pain points are, and how they currently interact with similar products or
								services.
								This phase is rooted in the principles of user-centred design, where the aim is to
								uncover insights that will drive the direction of the solution.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_right" src="./images/competitorAnalysis.png"
									alt="matrix of competitor analysis">
								User research is the cornerstone of this phase. This can take many forms: interviews,
								surveys, competitor analysis, user testing, analytics reviews, and field observations.
								By gathering qualitative and quantitative data, I aim to create a comprehensive picture
								of the users, their behaviours, motivations, and frustrations.
								This is not just about gathering information, but interpreting it in a way that reveals
								underlying needs that may not be immediately obvious.
								The research phase also involves identifying and understanding market trends, emerging
								technologies, and competitive landscapes to ensure that the design solutions are not
								only user-friendly but also innovative and relevant.
								<br><br>
								With the insights gathered from research, the next step is to explore a range of
								possibilities and directions for the design.
								This involves brainstorming, sketching, and developing initial concepts that might
								address the user needs identified in the previous phase.
								I often use tools like user personas, journey maps, and empathy maps to organise these
								insights and provide a visual guide to the users' experiences, helping to align the team
								and stakeholders around the user’s core needs.
								<br><br>
								Empathy and research provide a solid foundation that allows the design to be both
								user-driven and contextually relevant.
								It ensures that the resulting solutions aren’t just based on assumptions but are backed
								by real-world data and insights.
								By staying close to the user’s needs and environment, the design process moves from
								abstract to tangible, with clear targets and well-informed decisions at every stage.

						Divergent thinking
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Once I’ve gathered insights and explored different avenues, the next step is to embrace
								divergent thinking.
								This phase is about generating as many ideas and potential solutions as possible—without
								immediately worrying about their feasibility or limitations.
								The goal is to break free from conventional thinking and push creative boundaries to
								uncover innovative solutions that could address the user needs and project goals in new
								ways.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_left" src="./images/discovery.png" alt="stakeholder research data">
								During divergent thinking, I use brainstorming techniques, mind mapping, and design
								sprints to quickly generate multiple ideas.
								This is a time for pushing the envelope and exploring the edges of what might be
								possible within the context of the project.
								At this stage, no idea is too wild, and no suggestion is dismissed too quickly. Every
								potential solution is considered, from small tweaks to existing ideas to entirely new,
								bold concepts that could transform the user experience.
								<br><br>
								Divergence in design encourages creativity and allows for diverse perspectives.
								It’s a way to challenge assumptions and broaden the design space, ensuring that we don’t
								settle for the first or most obvious idea that comes to mind.
								By looking at the problem from different angles and considering a wide range of
								solutions, we increase the likelihood of finding the most effective and innovative
								design approach.
								This open-minded approach helps uncover unexpected solutions and makes the design
								process more dynamic and iterative.
								<br><br>
								While divergent thinking encourages freedom and creativity, it’s important to recognise
								that the ideas generated during this phase will eventually need to be refined and
								narrowed down.
								Divergence is only one part of the design process; after this phase, we enter the
								process of convergence, where we’ll take the best ideas and explore them in greater
								depth.

					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Once we have a wide array of ideas from the divergent thinking phase, it’s time to begin
								narrowing down those ideas and testing their viability.
								This is where the concept starts to take shape in tangible form.
								Prototyping is a key part of the process, and I use this phase to translate abstract
								concepts into working models, whether they are low-fidelity wireframes or high-fidelity
								interactive prototypes.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_left" src="./images/userJourneyMaps.png" alt="user journey mapping">
								Prototypes allow us to visualise how the design will function, enabling us to explore
								interactions, flows, and user journeys in a way that static designs can’t.
								During this phase, I focus on creating something simple but interactive enough to
								demonstrate core functionality, whether it’s a clickable wireframe or an interactive
								mockup.
								Prototypes make it easier to identify usability issues early on and allow for quick
								iteration based on user feedback.
								<br><br>
								Refinement is the natural next step after prototyping. This is where the design is
								iterated upon, optimised, and aligned more closely with user needs and project
								requirements.
								Based on feedback from usability tests, user sessions, and team reviews, I refine the
								design by improving visual elements, interaction patterns, and flow.
								This is a collaborative process where both design and development teams may offer input
								on technical feasibility and user interaction, ensuring that the solution not only looks
								good but works well.
								<br><br>
								Testing plays a critical role in this phase. Whether it’s A/B testing, user testing, or
								accessibility audits, I ensure that the design is evaluated from all angles before
								moving on to the development stage.
								This includes testing with real users to uncover pain points, gauge user satisfaction,
								and ensure that the design is intuitive and functional.
								Testing helps mitigate risks by allowing us to identify flaws early and make necessary
								adjustments before the product goes live.

							<p>
								After refining and testing prototypes, the next stage in the process is moving into
								development, where the design begins to come to life in code.
								At this point, I work in close collaboration with the design and development teams to
								turn wireframes and mockups into functional, interactive experiences.
								My experience as both a designer and frontend developer allows me to bridge the gap
								between design and development, ensuring that the final product is both visually
								appealing and technically robust.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_right" src="./images/wireframing.png" alt="wireframe designs">
								In this phase, I work alongside developers to ensure that the design is faithfully
								translated into code while maintaining a high standard of usability, performance, and
								accessibility.
								I help write clean, efficient code, and ensure that it adheres to the best practices for
								front-end development. Whether it's building responsive layouts, implementing
								animations, or integrating with backend services,
								the development phase is where the user interface and interactions take shape.
								<br><br>
								But even as development progresses, testing doesn’t stop. In fact, this phase involves
								more intensive testing, as we ensure the product works across different devices,
								browsers, and screen sizes.
								I conduct thorough quality assurance (QA) testing, where I focus on usability,
								functionality, and performance.
								User testing is also crucial here to confirm that the end product performs as expected
								in real-world conditions.
								Feedback loops continue with stakeholders to ensure the solution meets business goals
								and user needs.
								<br><br>
								In parallel with development, I ensure that the project undergoes rigorous accessibility
								testing, ensuring that the product is usable by people with various disabilities.
								Testing, optimisation, and collaboration during this stage make sure the product is not
								only functional but also polished and ready for release.

								A solid design process isn’t linear; it’s a dynamic, iterative journey. By deeply
								understanding the problem, empathising with users, exploring ideas, prototyping and
								testing rigorously,
								and working closely with development, we can create a product that truly resonates with
								users and achieves business goals.
								This process is a blend of research, creativity, testing, and collaboration—where every
								phase builds on the last, ensuring that the final result is a thoughtful, effective, and
								user-centric solution.
								<br><br>
								At the heart of this process is a commitment to understanding and solving real user
								problems. Whether I’m working with a brand-new concept or refining an existing product,
								I strive for design solutions that are not only aesthetically pleasing but are also
								functional, efficient, and intuitive.
								Ultimately, a great design process brings together the best of strategy, creativity, and
								technology to create solutions that drive tangible, lasting results.
