						The problem and the scope
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Every successful project begins with a clear understanding of the problem at hand and the scope within which it must be solved. 
								This first step is all about framing the project correctly, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned, and establishing a foundation that will guide the rest of the design process. 
								At this stage, I collaborate closely with clients, stakeholders, and internal teams to gather as much context and information as possible. 
								Through in-depth discussions, surveys, and review of any existing documentation, I identify the core objectives, constraints, and pain points that the project aims to address.
								<br><br>
								Defining the scope is crucial because it outlines the parameters of the project—what is within scope and what is not—ensuring that resources are allocated effectively. 
								This clarity minimises scope creep and helps manage expectations throughout the project's lifecycle. 
								A well-delineated scope will also inform decisions on functionality, user flows, and technical requirements. 
								By diving deep into the business goals and the context surrounding the project, I establish a clear roadmap for the next phases. 
								This understanding also allows me to highlight any potential risks early on, from technical challenges to user adoption hurdles, so we can address them proactively.
								<br><br>
								Additionally, setting out clear success metrics early on helps everyone involved measure progress and know when the project is truly complete. 
								Whether it’s a target conversion rate, user retention goal, or market share increase, these key performance indicators (KPIs) give us a solid foundation for decision-making throughout the design and development process. 
								In sum, a well-defined problem and scope ensure that all subsequent efforts stay focused, purposeful, and aligned with business goals, creating a strong foundation for the work to come.

						Empathise, research and explore
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								With a clear understanding of the problem and scope in place, the next step in the process is to build empathy for the end users. 
								The goal here is to dive deep into understanding who the users are, what they need, what their pain points are, and how they currently interact with similar products or services. 
								This phase is rooted in the principles of user-centreed design, where the aim is to uncover insights that will drive the direction of the solution.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_right" src="./images/competitorAnalysis.png" alt="matrix of competitor analysis">
								User research is the cornerstone of this phase. This can take many forms: interviews, surveys, competitor analysis, user testing, analytics reviews, and field observations. 
								By gathering qualitative and quantitative data, I aim to create a comprehensive picture of the users, their behaviours, motivations, and frustrations. 
								This is not just about gathering information, but interpreting it in a way that reveals underlying needs that may not be immediately obvious. 
								The research phase also involves identifying and understanding market trends, emerging technologies, and competitive landscapes to ensure that the design solutions are not only user-friendly but also innovative and relevant.
								<br><br>
								With the insights gathered from research, the next step is to explore a range of possibilities and directions for the design. 
								This involves brainstorming, sketching, and developing initial concepts that might address the user needs identified in the previous phase. 
								I often use tools like user personas, journey maps, and empathy maps to organise these insights and provide a visual guide to the users' experiences, helping to align the team and stakeholders around the user’s core needs.
								<br><br>
								Empathy and research provide a solid foundation that allows the design to be both user-driven and contextually relevant. 
								It ensures that the resulting solutions aren’t just based on assumptions but are backed by real-world data and insights. 
								By staying close to the user’s needs and environment, the design process moves from abstract to tangible, with clear targets and well-informed decisions at every stage.

						Divergent thinking
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Once I’ve gathered insights and explored different avenues, the next step is to embrace divergent thinking. 
								This phase is about generating as many ideas and potential solutions as possible—without immediately worrying about their feasibility or limitations. 
								The goal is to break free from conventional thinking and push creative boundaries to uncover innovative solutions that could address the user needs and project goals in new ways.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_left" src="./images/discovery.png" alt="stakeholder research data">
								During divergent thinking, I use brainstorming techniques, mind mapping, and design sprints to quickly generate multiple ideas. 
								This is a time for pushing the envelope and exploring the edges of what might be possible within the context of the project. 
								At this stage, no idea is too wild, and no suggestion is dismissed too quickly. Every potential solution is considered, from small tweaks to existing ideas to entirely new, bold concepts that could transform the user experience.
								<br><br>
								Divergence in design encourages creativity and allows for diverse perspectives. 
								It’s a way to challenge assumptions and broaden the design space, ensuring that we don’t settle for the first or most obvious idea that comes to mind. 
								By looking at the problem from different angles and considering a wide range of solutions, we increase the likelihood of finding the most effective and innovative design approach. 
								This open-minded approach helps uncover unexpected solutions and makes the design process more dynamic and iterative.
								<br><br>
								While divergent thinking encourages freedom and creativity, it’s important to recognise that the ideas generated during this phase will eventually need to be refined and narrowed down. 
								Divergence is only one part of the design process; after this phase, we enter the process of convergence, where we’ll take the best ideas and explore them in greater depth.
							</p>

						Prototype, refine & test
					</label>
					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								Once we have a wide array of ideas from the divergent thinking phase, it’s time to begin narrowing down those ideas and testing their viability. 
								This is where the concept starts to take shape in tangible form. 
								Prototyping is a key part of the process, and I use this phase to translate abstract concepts into working models, whether they are low-fidelity wireframes or high-fidelity interactive prototypes.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_left" src="./images/userJourneyMaps.png" alt="user journey mapping">
								Prototypes allow us to visualise how the design will function, enabling us to explore interactions, flows, and user journeys in a way that static designs can’t. 
								During this phase, I focus on creating something simple but interactive enough to demonstrate core functionality, whether it’s a clickable wireframe or an interactive mockup. 
								Prototypes make it easier to identify usability issues early on and allow for quick iteration based on user feedback.
								<br><br>
								Refinement is the natural next step after prototyping. This is where the design is iterated upon, optimised, and aligned more closely with user needs and project requirements. 
								Based on feedback from usability tests, user sessions, and team reviews, I refine the design by improving visual elements, interaction patterns, and flow. 
								This is a collaborative process where both design and development teams may offer input on technical feasibility and user interaction, ensuring that the solution not only looks good but works well.
								<br><br>
								Testing plays a critical role in this phase. Whether it’s A/B testing, user testing, or accessibility audits, I ensure that the design is evaluated from all angles before moving on to the development stage. 
								This includes testing with real users to uncover pain points, gauge user satisfaction, and ensure that the design is intuitive and functional. 
								Testing helps mitigate risks by allowing us to identify flaws early and make necessary adjustments before the product goes live.

					<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
						<div class="faq-drawer__content">
							<p>
								After refining and testing prototypes, the next stage in the process is moving into development, where the design begins to come to life in code. 
								At this point, I work  in close collaboration with the design and development teams to turn wireframes and mockups into functional, interactive experiences. 
								My experience as both a designer and frontend developer allows me to bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring that the final product is both visually appealing and technically robust.
							</p>
							<p><img class="img_right" src="./images/wireframing.png" alt="wireframe designs">
								In this phase, I work alongside developers to ensure that the design is faithfully translated into code while maintaining a high standard of usability, performance, and accessibility. 
								I help write clean, efficient code, and ensure that it adheres to the best practices for front-end development. Whether it's building responsive layouts, implementing animations, or integrating with backend services, 
								the development phase is where the user interface and interactions take shape.
								<br><br>
								But even as development progresses, testing doesn’t stop. In fact, this phase involves more intensive testing, as we ensure the product works across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. 
								I conduct thorough quality assurance (QA) testing, where I focus on usability, functionality, and performance. 
								User testing is also crucial here to confirm that the end product performs as expected in real-world conditions. 
								Feedback loops continue with stakeholders to ensure the solution meets business goals and user needs.
								<br><br>
								In parallel with development, I ensure that the project undergoes rigorous accessibility testing, ensuring that the product is usable by people with various disabilities. 
								Testing, optimisation, and collaboration during this stage make sure the product is not only functional but also polished and ready for release.

								A solid design process isn’t linear; it’s a dynamic, iterative journey. By deeply understanding the problem, empathising with users, exploring ideas, prototyping and testing rigorously, 
								and working closely with development, we can create a product that truly resonates with users and achieves business goals. 
								This process is a blend of research, creativity, testing, and collaboration—where every phase builds on the last, ensuring that the final result is a thoughtful, effective, and user-centric solution.
								<br><br>
								At the heart of this process is a commitment to understanding and solving real user problems. Whether I’m working with a brand-new concept or refining an existing product, 
								I strive for design solutions that are not only aesthetically pleasing but are also functional, efficient, and intuitive. 
								Ultimately, a great design process brings together the best of strategy, creativity, and technology to create solutions that drive tangible, lasting results.

								How much does it cost to build a website?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										The cost of building a website depends on various factors such as complexity, features,	design, and ongoing maintenance. I provide transparent pricing estimates upfront, tailored to your specific requirements and budget constraints.
									</p>
									<p>
										But that doesn’t really answer the question, right?! So, let’s use a simple 3-page site with no	online store or crazy add-ons as an example:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Bespoke designed site, fully computer & mobile friendly – approx. £500.
										</li>
										<li>Domain, Hosting, SSL Certificate – approx. £150 annually.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Obviously bigger, more complex and high traffic sites will cost more, so get in touch to discuss your project and receive a personalised quote.

								What is your timeline for completing a project?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Similar to the cost of building a site, the timeline depends on a number of factors but	laying out a clear plan of deliverables and ensuring both of us understand the workflow	helps manage expectations and ensures an efficient delivery.
									</p>
									<p>
										To use a simple 3-page site as an example, it would typically be week once all content (text and images etc) are provided.
									</p>
									<p>
										Obviously bigger, more complex projects will take longer but getting a minimum viable product live asap would be key before iterating and adding features and content as required.

								Can you organise domain registration and web hosting setup?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										In a word, yes! I can recommend reliable hosting providers based on your needs and budget.  We'll assist you in setting up your hosting account and ensure your website is properly	configured for optimal performance and security.
									</p>
									<p>
										Or for a small annual fee I can setup both domain and hosting and continually manage all of the	above, as well as the renewals on your behalf.  I can also work with any existing domain & hosting services you have.

								What is your process for working with clients?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										My client-centric approach involves collaborating closely with yourself throughout the entire project lifecycle.
									</p>
									<p>
										This includes:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Initial consultation to discuss project requirements, goals, and timeline as well as any follow-on research that may be required.</li>
										<li>Regular communication and updates to ensure transparency and alignment.</li>
										<li>Iterative design and development phases with opportunities for feedback and revisions.
										</li>
										<li>Thorough testing and quality assurance to deliver a polished final product.</li>
										<li>Follow-up support and maintenance to address any initial post-launch needs or issues.
										</li>
									</ul>

								How do you handle revisions and feedback during the design and development process?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										It’s often hard to know exactly what you want until you see what you’ve got, and so	amendments and revisions are an inevitable part of the development process.
									</p>
									<p>
										I usually allow for a couple rounds of revisions as part of a project, and after that can work with you to see if we need to expand the scope of the project.

						<div class="faq-drawer">

								Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance after the website is launched?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Yes, I offer ongoing support and maintenance services to ensure that your website remains up-to-date, secure, and optimised for performance. Whether it's fixing bugs, updating	content, or implementing new features, I'm here to support your website's long-term success.
									</p>
									<p>
										Typically, I provide up to 2hrs of support a month (anything over that will be charged at an hourly rate) for the following rates:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>less than 4k visits - £15 per month (or £150 for annual payment) *</li>
										<li>4k to 10K visits - £30 per month (or £300 for annual payment) *</li>
										<li>over 10K visits - £100 per month (or £1000 for annual payment) *</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										*The majority of the cost goes to covering the cost of hosting the site, not sure how much traffic you’ll get? Don’t worry, as part of our initial discussions, I can estimate based on	competitors and similar sites.

								Can I update my website content myself after it's launched?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Yes, I can incorporate a content management system (CMS) into your website, allowing you to	easily update and manage your content without needing technical expertise.
									</p>
									<p>
										One such popular CMS options is WordPress, but I can work with others if you’d prefer. I’ll provide training and some support to ensure you're comfortable managing your website going forward.

								And what if I want an app for my business?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										If you're considering an app for your business, I can guide you through the entire process, from initial planning to launch.
									</p>
									<p>
										We'll start by discussing your goals, target audience, and the features you need. Whether you need a mobile app for iOS, Android, or both, I’ll ensure the design and functionality align with your business objectives.
									</p>
									<p>	
										I’ll handle all aspects of the project, including user research, wireframing, design, development, and testing. If the project requires additional expertise or resources, I can bring in trusted developers to ensure we meet your needs and deadlines. Throughout the process, I’ll keep you informed and involved, ensuring the final product exceeds your expectations. Plus, I’ll build your app with scalability in mind, so it can grow alongside your business, adapting to new features or increasing demand in the future.
									</p>
									<p>
										Once the app is ready, I’ll assist with deployment and provide ongoing support as needed. Let’s work together to create an app that helps your business thrive now and in the future.

				<article>
					<p>
						Away from the computer, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. Living near the coast of
						South Devon with my wife and 2 girls, you'll often find me embracing the beach, with its
						soothing waves & sandy shores. Swimming in the refreshing sea and cycling the rolling hills are
						my preferred ways to unwind and stay invigorated. Life is a balance, and in these outdoor
						pursuits, I discover the perfect counterpoint to my digital endeavours, ensuring a well-rounded
						and fulfilling existence beyond the realm of code and design.
