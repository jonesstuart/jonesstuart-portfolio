						<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
						<div class="faq-drawer">
							<input class="faq-drawer__trigger" id="faq-1" type="checkbox"><label class="faq-drawer__title"
								for="faq-1">
								How much does it cost to build a website?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										The cost of building a website depends on various factors such as complexity, features,	design, and ongoing maintenance. I provide transparent pricing estimates upfront, tailored to your specific requirements and budget constraints.
									</p>
									<p>
										But that doesn’t really answer the question, right?! So, let’s use a simple 3-page site with no	online store or crazy add-ons as an example:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Bespoke designed site, fully computer & mobile friendly – approx. £500.
										</li>
										<li>Domain, Hosting, SSL Certificate – approx. £150 annually.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Obviously bigger, more complex and high traffic sites will cost more, so get in touch to discuss your project and receive a personalised quote.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
			
						<div class="faq-drawer">
							<input class="faq-drawer__trigger" id="faq-2" type="checkbox"><label class="faq-drawer__title"
								for="faq-2">
								What is your timeline for completing a project?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Similar to the cost of building a site, the timeline depends on a number of factors but	laying out a clear plan of deliverables and ensuring both of us understand the workflow	helps manage expectations and ensures an efficient delivery.
									</p>
									<p>
										To use a simple 3-page site as an example, it would typically be week once all content (text and images etc) are provided.
									</p>
									<p>
										Obviously bigger, more complex projects will take longer but getting a minimum viable product live asap would be key before iterating and adding features and content as required.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
			
						<div class="faq-drawer">
							<input class="faq-drawer__trigger" id="faq-3" type="checkbox"><label class="faq-drawer__title"
								for="faq-3">
								Can you organise domain registration and web hosting setup?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										In a word, yes! I can recommend reliable hosting providers based on your needs and budget.  We'll assist you in setting up your hosting account and ensure your website is properly	configured for optimal performance and security.
									</p>
									<p>
										Or for a small annual fee I can setup both domain and hosting and continually manage all of the	above, as well as the renewals on your behalf.  I can also work with any existing domain & hosting services you have.

								What is your process for working with clients?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										My client-centric approach involves collaborating closely with yourself throughout the entire project lifecycle.
									</p>
									<p>
										This includes:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Initial consultation to discuss project requirements, goals, and timeline as well as any follow-on research that may be required.</li>
										<li>Regular communication and updates to ensure transparency and alignment.</li>
										<li>Iterative design and development phases with opportunities for feedback and revisions.
										</li>
										<li>Thorough testing and quality assurance to deliver a polished final product.</li>
										<li>Follow-up support and maintenance to address any initial post-launch needs or issues.
										</li>

								How do you handle revisions and feedback during the design and development process?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										It’s often hard to know exactly what you want until you see what you’ve got, and so	amendments and revisions are an inevitable part of the development process.
									</p>
									<p>
										I usually allow for a couple rounds of revisions as part of a project, and after that can work with you to see if we need to expand the scope of the project.

						</div>
			
						<div class="faq-drawer">
							<input class="faq-drawer__trigger" id="faq-6" type="checkbox"><label class="faq-drawer__title"

								Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance after the website is launched?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Yes, I offer ongoing support and maintenance services to ensure that your website remains up-to-date, secure, and optimized for performance. Whether it's fixing bugs, updating	content, or implementing new features, I'm here to support your website's long-term success.
									</p>
									<p>
										Typically, I provide up to 2hrs of support a month (anything over that will be charged at an hourly rate) for the following rates:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>less than 4k visits - £15 per month (or £150 for annual payment) *</li>
										<li>4k to 10K visits - £30 per month (or £300 for annual payment) *</li>
										<li>over 10K visits - £100 per month (or £1000 for annual payment) *</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										*The majority of the cost goes to covering the cost of hosting the site, not sure how much traffic you’ll get? Don’t worry, as part of our initial discussions, I can estimate based on	competitors and similar sites.

								Can I update my website content myself after it's launched?
							</label>
							<div class="faq-drawer__content-wrapper">
								<div class="faq-drawer__content">
									<p>
										Yes, I can incorporate a content management system (CMS) into your website, allowing you to	easily update and manage your content without needing technical expertise.
									</p>
									<p>
										One such popular CMS options is WordPress, but I can work with others if you’d prefer. I’ll provide training and some support to ensure you're comfortable managing your website going forward.

										If you're considering an app for your business, I can guide you through the entire process, from initial planning to launch.
									</p>
									<p>
										We'll start by discussing your goals, target audience, and the features you need. Whether you need a mobile app for iOS, Android, or both, I’ll ensure the design and functionality align with your business objectives.
									</p>
									<p>	
										I’ll handle all aspects of the project, including user research, wireframing, design, development, and testing. If the project requires additional expertise or resources, I can bring in trusted developers to ensure we meet your needs and deadlines. Throughout the process, I’ll keep you informed and involved, ensuring the final product exceeds your expectations. Plus, I’ll build your app with scalability in mind, so it can grow alongside your business, adapting to new features or increasing demand in the future.
									</p>
									<p>
										Once the app is ready, I’ll assist with deployment and provide ongoing support as needed. Let’s work together to create an app that helps your business thrive now and in the future.

				<article>
					<p>
						Away from the computer, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. Living near the coast of
						South Devon with my wife and 2 girls, you'll often find me embracing the beach, with its
						soothing waves & sandy shores. Swimming in the refreshing sea and cycling the rolling hills are
						my preferred ways to unwind and stay invigorated. Life is a balance, and in these outdoor
						pursuits, I discover the perfect counterpoint to my digital endeavours, ensuring a well-rounded
						and fulfilling existence beyond the realm of code and design.
